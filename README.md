## 🏁 How to get started

1️⃣ Right-click **Start Course** &#8595; and open the link in a new tab.

2️⃣ In the new tab, 
   - For owner, choose your personal account or an organization to host the repository.
   - **We recommend creating a public repository**, as private repositories will [use Actions minutes](https://docs.github.com/en/billing/managing-billing-for-github-actions/about-billing-for-github-actions).
   - Give your repository a name, such as `JS-AI-Build-a-thon`
   - Scroll down and click the **Create repository** button at the bottom of the form.

3️⃣ After your new repository is created, **wait about 20 seconds, then refresh the page**. [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/actions) will automatically update to the next step. Follow the step-by-step instructions in the new repository's README.

4️⃣ Open a new browser tab, and work on the steps in your second tab while you read the instructions in this tab.
