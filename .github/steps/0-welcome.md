# üéâ Welcome to the JS AI Build-a-thon!

> **Note**
>
> We recommend opening another browser tab to work through the following activities so you can keep these instructions open for reference.

The goal of this build-a-thon is to help you learn how to build AI applications using JavaScript and TypeScript. This is a hands-on experience where you'll work through a series of user journeys, each designed to guide you through the process of building AI applications step by step.

You'll complete a series of exercises that will:-
- üß† Help you understand the fundamentals of AI and how it can be applied in JavaScript and TypeScript.
- üíª Provide you with practical experience in building AI applications, experimenting with different AI techniques.
- üõ†Ô∏è Introduce you to various tools, libraries, and frameworks that are commonly used in AI development.
- üë• Foster a community of learners and developers who are passionate about AI and its applications in JavaScript and TypeScript.
- üìÇ Help you build a portfolio of AI projects that showcase your skills and knowledge.

## üó∫Ô∏è How it works

The build-a-thon is structured around **user journeys**, each representing a different path you can take based on your current knowledge and goals. Check out the user journeys below to see which one aligns with your interests and experience level, and click on the corresponding badge to get started.

Each user journey has a **specified expected activity**, _(example, pushing code)_ that you need to complete before moving on to the next user journey. Once you complete the activity, **GitHub Actions will automatically trigger the next step in your journey**. This ensures that you progress through the build-a-thon in a structured manner, building on your knowledge and skills as you go.

> **Note**
>
> ‚≠ê If you are a complete beginner, **we recommend starting from the first user journey and progressing sequentially**. This will help you build a solid foundation in AI concepts and techniques and progress to more advanced topics.
> 
> üîÑ If you would like to reset your progress, you can do so by clicking the **Reset** button in the top of each page. This will reset your progress and allow you to start over from the beginning.
